      <h2>Comprehensive Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Laryngeal morphological features contribute significantly to airway obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), though standardized evaluation methods are limited. We conducted a retrospective analysis involving fiberoptic laryngoscopy videos from 145 patients (88 OSA, 54 controls, 3 incomplete assessments) to investigate specific laryngeal anomalies and quantify reliability across features including laryngomalacia, arytenoid position, epiglottic shape/prolapse, and post-cricoid redundancy. Results indicated moderate inter-rater reliability specifically for epiglottic prolapse, with younger patients showing greater severity. Interestingly, traditional OSA risk factors such as obesity, COPD, and GERD did not predict laryngeal morphology outcomes, underscoring the independence of laryngeal anomalies as critical diagnostic and treatment targets.

      <h2>Detailed Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Patients underwent standardized fiberoptic laryngoscopy with evaluations conducted by two independent, blinded otolaryngologists. Cohen’s kappa assessed inter-rater reliability. Demographics including age, gender, BMI, and comorbidities were recorded. Logistic regression analyzed associations between laryngeal morphology and clinical factors like OSA severity, obesity, GERD, and COPD.

      <h2>In-Depth Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Epiglottic prolapse showed highest reliability (κ=0.318, p<0.001).</li>
        <li>Lower agreement observed for laryngomalacia and post-cricoid redundancy.</li>
        <li>Age inversely correlated with epiglottic prolapse severity (β=–0.089, p=0.035).</li>
        <li>No significant associations between traditional risk factors and laryngeal morphology.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Expanded Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        The findings emphasize the critical yet often overlooked role of laryngeal structures, particularly the epiglottis, in OSA pathophysiology. Younger patients appear especially susceptible, potentially indicating unique etiological mechanisms. The complexity of accurately identifying subtle features highlights the need for improved diagnostic frameworks. The clinical implications suggest targeted therapeutic interventions like epiglottopexy could significantly enhance treatment outcomes.

      <h2>Future Research Directions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prospective, multicenter studies using standardized DISE protocols.</li>
        <li>Integration of computational modeling and AI-driven image analysis.</li>
        <li>Focused research on the neuromuscular and genetic underpinnings of laryngeal laxity.</li>
        <li>Development of universally accepted laryngeal morphology scoring systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Retrospective nature and potential selection bias.</li>
        <li>Limited sample size, particularly post-laryngectomy patients.</li>
        <li>Incomplete postoperative outcome data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Recognition and standardized assessment of laryngeal features, notably epiglottic prolapse, are crucial in understanding and managing adult OSA. Incorporating advanced diagnostic and therapeutic modalities into clinical practice promises improved patient outcomes, particularly among younger or traditionally resistant cases.
