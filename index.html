      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p><strong>Background:</strong> While oropharyngeal structures are classically implicated in OSA, increasing evidence supports a role for laryngeal elements, especially the epiglottis.</p>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate inter-rater reliability of laryngeal features observed during drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) and to explore relationships with OSA severity and partial laryngectomy.</p>
      <p><strong>Methods:</strong> Retrospective review of adult patients undergoing DISE, including rating of epiglottic prolapse, laryngomalacia, and post-cricoid redundancy by multiple blinded reviewers. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using kappa statistics. Demographic and clinical correlations were examined.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> Epiglottic prolapse showed moderate inter-rater agreement, while other features demonstrated slight-to-fair agreement. Younger patients more frequently had epiglottic prolapse. Those with partial laryngectomy displayed higher OSA severity and laryngeal irregularities.</p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Laryngeal structures may contribute to OSA in select patients. Epiglottic collapse, in particular, may help explain CPAP intolerance or surgical failure, especially in younger individuals. Standardized protocols and further prospective studies are needed.</p>

      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Moderate agreement for identifying epiglottic prolapse on DISE</li>
        <li>Lower reliability for laryngomalacia and post-cricoid redundancy</li>
        <li>Younger adults more likely to show epiglottic collapse</li>
        <li>Partial laryngectomy patients had worse OSA metrics and structural distortion</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Expanded Discussion</h2>
      <p>Our findings shed light on how overlooked laryngeal elements—especially epiglottic morphology—may be critical in certain OSA phenotypes. While traditional paradigms have emphasized soft palate and tongue base collapse, it is increasingly clear that the epiglottis plays a dynamic role, particularly in younger patients and those with unique anatomic backgrounds (e.g., partial laryngectomy).</p>

      <p>Epiglottic prolapse was one of the more reliably observed features, suggesting it may be a consistent target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Conversely, the low agreement for post-cricoid redundancy and laryngomalacia highlights ongoing challenges with DISE interpretation in subtle cases.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, our small subgroup of patients post-partial laryngectomy revealed a trend toward greater structural compromise and OSA severity. This implies that resections may cause compensatory or destabilizing changes that exacerbate collapse during sleep.</p>

      <h2>Future Directions</h2>
      <p>We recommend future multicenter studies using consistent DISE protocols and enhanced rating systems, possibly supplemented by AI-based morphologic assessment. In addition, computational modeling could help quantify how specific laryngeal variations contribute to inspiratory collapse.</p>

      <p>Patients with unexplained OSA or poor surgical outcomes may benefit from targeted laryngeal evaluation, including dynamic airway imaging and consideration of site-specific procedures such as epiglottopexy, glossoepiglottopexy, or epiglottic stiffening.</p>

      <p>Research into laryngeal nerve integrity and reflex control could also open novel therapeutic avenues, especially if sensory dysfunction is found to promote collapse.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Laryngeal structures—long considered secondary—may have primary relevance in select OSA patients. Recognition and targeted intervention, especially for epiglottic collapse, could improve outcomes for patients who fail traditional therapies. Larger, standardized studies are necessary to fully establish laryngeal scoring metrics and therapeutic protocols.</p>
